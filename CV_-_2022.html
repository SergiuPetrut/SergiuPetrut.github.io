<p>Hi, I'm an System-on-Chip Design student from Transylvania. I'm studying at the University of Tampere with an expected graduation by May 2026.</p>
<p>My technical interests currently are electronics, IoT devices, computer hardware including CPU and GPU architecture as well as automotive engineering and telecommunications.</p>
<p>I'm also interested in broadening my skillset, namely with Rust, Chip Design, 6G, Lo-Ra, Wireless Meshes and other emerging technologies.</p>

                        <div class="info">
                            <p class="semi-bold">Embedded Software Development</p>
                            <p>I have spent 5 months at Kempower working on a Proof of Concept for communications in R&D, where I exclusively used Embedded C in order to develop a communications protocol based on CAN.</p>
                            <p>I have also worked quite a bit with power electronics and proprietary hardware during the same period, learning how everything is put together.</p>
                            <p>Additionaly I was also tasked with tackling sensors, in particular temperature probes and implementing them into the Proof of Concept.</p>
                            <p>This job allowed me to better understand how Research and Development is done, as I've worked on my project solo and I was treated like a real engineer.</p>	
                    <li>
                        <div class="date"> 2023 : May -> August</div>

                            <p class="semi-bold">Embedded Software + Electronics Design + Rig Testing</p>
                            <p>I have spent a whole summer at W채rtsil채 working on temperature sensors in R&D, I mostly used Embedded C for software development and some C++/Java for some smaller tasks.</p>
                            <p>Besides the software development, I was also tasked with electronics design and testing, getting to work directly with W채rtsil채 partners abroad.</p>
                            <p>I believe this position in particular taught me the most so far, as I've seen firsthand what it takes to take a product off a drawing board and put it into reality.</p>
                            <p> Also learned how to tackle-on problems independently, having completed almost every task assigned to me on my own.</p>
                    <li>

                            <p>I have spent 6 months working at Wapice developing Embedded code for their clients as well as writing a custom-made Qt application for another client. The whole process familiarised me with real life situations in the world of Embedded Systems and it has really opened my eyes as to how bare-metal and embedded linux are used in real products. </p>
                            <p>It should also be mentioned that, while working at Wapice, I've familiarised myself more with Agile Development as well as the Finnish working culture -  Which was surprisingly similar to my own, therefore settling in at the company was done rather fast.</p>

                            <p>At the time I worked at a psychiatric hospital. This experience would be my first extremely stressful work environment, which made me realise how important feelings like sympathy and empathy are both in life and in work relations.</p>
